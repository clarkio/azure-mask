# Azure Mask
This is a Chrome extension that will mask GUIDs (such as Subscription IDs) and email addresses with a blur. The intention of the extension is to make it easier to do screen recordings without revealing sensitive, personal, account information that may show up on screen.

4. Find the version you want of the packaged extension in `/extension/`
5. Drag the `azure-mask.crx` file to your Chrome window that has the extensions view open
